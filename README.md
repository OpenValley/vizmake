vizmake
=======

It visualizes actual variable values in Makefile at build time.

Usage:
* Go into make directory to build the modified version of GNU make. The binary file make should be in the make directory.
* Run `python vizmake.py` in any project as how you run `make`. Think of `python vizmake.py` as a `make` wrapper. You can pass any `make` command line arguments to `python vizmake.py`.
* Open web browser to see http://localhost:8000
