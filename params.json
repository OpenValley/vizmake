It runs a modified GNU `make` to collect trace data\r\nand visualizes some useful information of Makefile. Visualization provides\r\ndevelopers great insight of the make process.\r\n\r\nCurrent implementation supports:\r\n\r\n* Visualizing lines in Makefile that reference variables and the actual value of\r\n  a referenced variable during build time.\r\n* Viewing what commands are actually invoked during build time.\r\n\r\n## Installation and Usage\r\n\r\nLet $(VIZMAKE) be the path of the root directory of vizmake project.\r\n\r\n* Go into $(VIZMAKE)/make/ directory to build the modified version of GNU make. The binary\r\n  file `make` should be in the $(VIZMAKE)/make directory.\r\n* Run `python $(VIZMAKE)/vizmake.py` in any project as how you run `make`. Think of `python\r\n  vizmake.py` as a `make` wrapper. You can pass any `make` command line\r\n  arguments to `python $(VIZMAKE)/vizmake.py`. \r\n* Open web browser to see http://localhost:8000\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n### Run vizmake\r\nThis screenshot is in a terminal after running\r\n\r\n\t\t\tpython $(VIZMAKE)/vizmake.py all\r\n\r\nwhich is equivalent to\r\n\r\n\t\t\tmake all\r\n\r\nexcept for doing visualization:\r\n![screenshot](https://github.com/wenbinf/vizmake/raw/master/doc/vizmake_run.png)\r\n\r\n### Index page\r\n\r\nThis screenshot is in a browser showing all `make` processes and all command\r\nprocesses (e.g., gcc) spawned from a `make` process:\r\n![screenshot](https://github.com/wenbinf/vizmake/raw/master/doc/vizmake_index.png)\r\n\r\n### Full command line page\r\n\r\nThis screenshot is in a browser showing the full command line to execute a\r\nprocess after clicking on one CMD link in the index page:\r\n![screenshot](https://github.com/wenbinf/vizmake/raw/master/doc/vizmake_cmd.png)\r\n\r\n### Makefile variable view page\r\n\r\nThis screenshot is in a browser showing the visualization of Makefile's variable\r\nview after clicking on one VAR link in the index page:\r\n![screenshot](https://github.com/wenbinf/vizmake/raw/master/doc/vizmake_var.png)\r\n\r\nThis page visualizes the lines in a Makefile that reference some variables.
